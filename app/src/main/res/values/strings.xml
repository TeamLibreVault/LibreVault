    <string name="aeadbt_err_msg">"\n                We were unable to decrypt some of the files in your vault.\n                The app attempted to open your data using the secure key stored on this device, but the decryption process failed.\n\n                This issue can occur when the app has been uninstalled and then reinstalled, instead of updated through the normal update process. In such cases, Android may permanently remove the original encryption key required to access your data.\n\n                If the secure key was deleted and no proper backup was created beforehand, the affected files cannot be recovered, and the data is likely lost.\n\n                To prevent future data loss, please keep regular backups and avoid reinstalling the app without exporting or saving your encrypted data first.\n            "</string>
